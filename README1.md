Java To-Do List App (Console-Based)
A simple and interactive console-based To-Do List application written in Java. This project helps users manage their daily tasks effectively by allowing them to add, view, complete, and remove tasks—all through a clean command-line interface.

🚀 Features
📝 Add Tasks – Input task descriptions to build your to-do list

📋 View Tasks – Display all tasks with completion status

✔️ Mark Tasks as Completed – Track progress by checking off completed tasks

🗑️ Remove Tasks – Delete completed or unwanted tasks from the list

💡 User-Friendly Menu – Clear and easy-to-navigate console interface

🧱 Tech Stack
Language: Java (JDK 8 or above)

Tools: Scanner for input, ArrayList for task storage

Design Pattern: OOP with a simple Task class structure

🧮 How It Works
The user is prompted with a numbered menu to perform actions.

Tasks are stored in an in-memory ArrayList with attributes like description and completion status.

The user can continuously interact with the menu until they choose to exit the app.
